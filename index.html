          I started programming web pages with html in 2003. I loved writing the
          code and watching it become a beautiful page. I enjoyed making them
          for friends; simple workups to showcase their talent. After a little
          time exploring other avenues, I am returning with gusto! The passion
          is still fresh and I'm learning new things every day. I want to help
          make satisfying, elegant projects to satisfy client needs. While I'm
          doing this, I Want to continue always to learn new things and upgrade
          existing ideas. I would love to be a part of a team that either
          focuses each on their part of the greater whole, or that fully
          collaborates to put together the best end result for the task.
          Ultimately, my passion is for the the best product.

          When I'm not working or studying, I'm an avid media fan. I am
          developing a YouTube channel to entertain people with my takes on
          recent books, movies, tv shows, and concerts. Outside of that, I love
          hiking and coffee meetups.
